# User Controls for Fluid Simulations:
## All simulations
- right click to add a source of fluid
- 'p' pauses/unpauses the simulation

## 2D Simulations
- left click to move velocity field (think of this as manipulating wind!)
- [SPACE] switches between displaying the densities (default) and velocity fields
- Sliders can be controlled with the mouse

## 3D Simulations
*3D simulation is not complete - velocity fields are not in the code and density is represented using colors. Higher density is green, lower density is blue. Density below threshold (defaulted at 40%) is black.*
- "WASD" rotates camera
- Arrow keys moves camera
- Number keys changes threshold - 1 -> 10%, 2 -> 20%, ..., 9 -> 90%, 0 -> 100%
