#User Controls for Fluid Simulations:
- right click to add a source of fluid
- left click to move velocity field (like adding wind!)
- 'p' pauses/unpauses the simulation
- [SPACE] switches between displaying the densities (default) and velocity fields
- In 2D simulations, there are sliders that can be moved with the mouse

## 3D Simulations
*3D simulation is not complete - velocity fields are not in the code and density is represented using colors. Higher density is green, lower density is blue. Density below threshold (defaulted at 40%) is black.*
- "WASD" rotates camera
- Arrow keys moves camera
- Number keys changes threshold - 1 -> 10%, 2 -> 20%, ..., 9 -> 90%, 0 -> 100%
