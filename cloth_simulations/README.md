Controls for all cloth simulations:
- 'p' to pause/unpause *note that all simulations start paused*
- 'r' to restart simulation
- 'e' to switch mode (to movement mode or cloth manipulation mode)

If in movement mode:
- 'WASD' to rotate camera
- arrow keys to navigate space

If in cloth manipulation mode:
- [SPACE] to switch which part of the cloth you pull on
- arrow keys to pull a point of the cloth in a specific direction
